# WiDS-DeepVision_Odyssey

Welcome to the WiDS-DeepVision_Odyssey repository! This repository contains the solution for WiDS assignment-1, showcasing implementations of both ResNet and AlexNet for image classification tasks.

## Implementation Details

- ResNet and AlexNet architectures are implemented.
- Both architectures are explored in three scenarios: using pretrained weights, training from scratch (regularized), and training from scratch (unregularized).
- In the regularized scenario, an experiment with doubled learning rates is conducted, and additional plots are provided.

## Plots

The repository includes a total of 6 plots, with 3 from AlexNet and 3 from ResNet. Each plot illustrates different aspects of the model training and performance.

## Notebooks

- Two notebooks are dedicated to pretrained implementations.
- Three notebooks are included for each ResNet18 setting, providing a comprehensive exploration of the model's behavior.
- One notebook dedicated Completely to AlexNet
